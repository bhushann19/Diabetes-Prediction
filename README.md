# Diabetes-Prediction

### Build a machine learning system using Support Vector Machine(Classification Supervised Machine Learning) to predict whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Work FLow
### 1. Collecting Data
### 2. Data Pre-Processing
### 3. Splitting the Data (Train Test Split)
### 4. Feeding the data to Support Vector Machine Classifier
### 5. Predicting whether the patient diabetic or non-diabetic
